ExifMoveAndSort
---------------

This AppleScript must be used in conjonction with a Hazel rule n a source folders where
photos are downloaded or stored.

It requires ExifTool that can be found here: http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/

Source folders have to be set in the script file.

Target folders have to be set respectively to their source.

Photos are organized into the following folder hierarchy:
<YYYY>  / <m - month>

The locale is forced to fr_FR.UTF-8 because Hazel is using its own settings. Of course
if you don't need a special locale you may get rid of that part of the code.
